# marine-microorganisms-clustering

Abstract: Our primary objective in this analysis is to group microorganisms according to their type by utilizing state-ofthe-
art clustering algorithms. This will allow us to better understand the different species in the dataset and the
various characteristics that define them. The dataset comprises more than 1 million unannotated images gathered
from the ocean by marine biologists associated with the Weizmann Institute. We will also closely examine the
dataâ€™s temporal trends to identify patterns that may emerge over time. In addition to our primary objectives, we
will perform various secondary analyses to explore the dataset further. This may include visualizing the data in
different ways to gain new perspectives or utilizing machine learning techniques to identify complex patterns that
may be difficult to discern through traditional analysis methods.
